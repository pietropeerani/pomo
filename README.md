This is a simple Pomodoro timer program written in C that helps improve productivity by following the Pomodoro Technique. The program provides a visual interface using the curses library, displaying a countdown timer for work intervals and break periods.

The core idea of the Pomodoro Technique is to work for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four work sessions, a longer break of 15 is taken. The program allows users to configure these durations, track their progress, and view session statistics.
